1. **Open Safari** on your iPhone/iPad
2. **Go to**: `https://wise-family-expenses.vercel.app`

## 🤖 For Android (Chrome/Edge)

**Important:** On Android, "Add to Home screen" IS the install option. There's no separate "Install app" menu item - that's the standard way to install PWAs on Android.

3. **Sign in** with Google (if not already signed in)
4. **Tap the menu** (three dots ☰) in the top-right corner

6. **Tap "Add"** or "Install" in the popup
7. **Done!** The app icon will appear on your home screen

**Note:** 
- "Add to Home screen" = Install PWA (this is correct!)
